Internship project: Using Million song dataset 

This project aimed to build a recommendation system for songs based on their sentiment score, artist popularity, and artist followers. The project used text pre-processing techniques and sentiment analysis to determine the emotional tone of each song's lyrics, and then combined this with the popularity and followers of the artist to create a song rating. Cosine similarity was used to measure the similarity between songs based on their sentiment score and artist popularity, allowing the system to generate a list of the 10 most similar songs to a given input song.

The project also created a dashboard using Power BI to visualize and explore the dataset, including charts and tables showing the distribution of genres and the number of songs by artist.

Overall, the project provides a tool for users to discover new songs based on their preferences, although the effectiveness of the recommendation system will depend on the quality of the features used, the accuracy of the sentiment analysis, and the relevance of the cosine similarity metric to the task at hand.
